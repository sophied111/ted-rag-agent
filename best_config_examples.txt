Title: "How to grow a forest in your backyard" — Shubhendu Sharma

Short summary of the key idea (from the provided TED data):
Shubhendu Sharma shows how to create ultra‑dense, biodiverse mini‑forests even in cities or a home garden by working with natural processes. As the description puts it, he grows these “ultra‑dense, biodiverse mini‑forests of native species in urban areas by engineering soil, microbes and biomass to kickstart natural growth processes” and even explains how to grow “a 100‑year‑old forest in just 10 years.” In the talk he describes practical steps: improve local soil by mixing in biomass (peat, bagasse) so water can penetrate and be held; “add microorganisms to the soil” so they “produce the nutrients… the soil starts breathing again. It becomes alive”; choose native species from historical sources and plant them in four vertical layers, densely and close together; mulch the surface and water for the first 2–3 years, then let the established root, fungal and microbial networks allow the forest to regenerate itself. These steps turn a small urban plot into a self‑sustaining “tiny jungle party.”

Recommend: "The coming neurological epidemic" — Gregory Petsko (talk_id 408).

Why: The talk’s description states Petsko "makes a convincing argument that, in the next 50 years, we'll see an epidemic of neurological diseases... as the world population ages." In the transcript he warns, "Unless we do something to prevent it, over the next 40 years we’re facing an epidemic of neurologic diseases on a global scale," explains why aging raises risks (Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s), outlines scientific approaches (e.g., drugs that act like "molecular Scotch tape" to stop protein misfolding), and offers practical takeaways and calls for more brain research and private philanthropy.
